# tic_tac_toe

A classic Tic Tac Toe game.
This app was developed using Flutter.
The app includes only 2 player mode of tic tac toe with a timer.
While the 2 player mode is functional, other features like single player  mode and leaderboard are not yet added.
The app also has light mode and dark mode which can be changed by changing the device theme preference.
I am sorry for not being able to comment the app because of time restraint.
